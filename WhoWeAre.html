            <p class="Qualifications">
              We adhere to the following principles in doing our work:
            </p>
            <p class="SubtitleCentre">
              <br /><br />
              We always act in the best interests of our client company.
              <br /><br />
              We always act discretely, committed to non-disclosure.
              <br /><br />
              We act as objectively as possible and are continually aware of
              bias.
              <br /><br />
              We act with honesty.
              <br /><br />
              We listen carefully and ask lots of questions.
              <br /><br />
              If we don't know, we say so. Then we find out who does know and
              learn from them.
              <br /><br />
              We deliver results to the best of our ability 100% of the time.
